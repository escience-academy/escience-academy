### Our Audience
Thoughts about what the "Audience" section should cover were varied, so this could use more discussion.  Currently we have [Profiles (SWC)](https://software-carpentry.org/audience/), [testimonials (SWC)](https://software-carpentry.org/testimonials/), [audience (LC)](https://librarycarpentry.org/audience/), and [stories (LC)](https://librarycarpentry.org/our-stories/).  There wasn't consensus in this round of review what should go on lesson program specific sites and what should go on The Carpentries site.
