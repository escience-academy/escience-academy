There was not a lot of consensus on what should go here and what should go on the [contact](/contact) page.  This will require further discussion.  This includes what channels to communicate or connect should be represented. Should they be organized by platform (Twitter, GitHub, Slack, etc.) or thematically (Maintainers, Instructors, etc.)?  Should we focus on lesson program specific content or include Carpentries wide content?
