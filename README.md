### About this site

Currently, the three lesson program sites use the same template but are organized in different ways. They also contain different information, both lesson program specific and general to The Carpentries.  

This site is a mockup of what a standard Carpentries lesson program website would look like.  Most of the content is filler text, but also includes notes about what the intent of the page is, and what questions need to be resolved before fully releasing this as a template for lesson program sites.
