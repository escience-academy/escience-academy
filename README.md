## About this site

Currently, the three lesson program sites use the same template but are organized in different ways. They also contain different information, both lesson program specific and general to The Carpentries.  

This site is a mockup of what a standard Carpentries lesson program website would look like.  Most of the content is filler text, but also includes notes about what the intent of the page is, and what questions need to be resolved before fully releasing this as a template for lesson program sites.

Feedback on the layout and navigation of this mock site was received from a group of people representing various roles and levels of experience with The Carpentries.  For reference, feedback documents are [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WPDT1ZPTLkrMHZwi70l4dKxAVbXZyod_) (available only to The Carpentries staff).


## Summary of Feedback
Additional notes are in the mock website pages themselves.

#### Connecting lesson programs to The Carpentries
Reviewers agreed it was difficult to immediately see the connection between the featured lesson program, other lesson programs, and The Carpentries.  We did not get concrete feedback on how to improve this, so this will need to be discussed more.

#### Front Page
Reviewers agreed that the front page layout with the sections on *Our Workshops*, *Our Lessons*, and *Get Involved* best represented what visitors may want to know.

There is a section featuring blog posts. However, we will need to decide whether to include this as most lesson programs do not have active blogs.

#### About Page
Reviewers agreed it was useful to have this information on one page, linking out to more information as appropriate.

The sections on "Our Audience" and "Additional Reading" need more consideration.  There was not consensus among our reviewers as to what should be included here.

#### Workshops menu 
Reviewers agreed this contains everything they would want to see here.

#### Lessons menu
This round of reviews was not considering changing the lessons page on each website. However, these pages could be more consistently designed.  Suggestions also included crediting former lesson maintainers and adding information targeted to learners (like software installation instructions).

*Curriculum Advisors*: Each lesson program lists its curriculum advisors differently. This should be standardized across all sites.

*License*: The existing lesson programs have different ways of listing the license and can get out of date from the most current CC-BY, so this links directly to the CC-BY source page. Note that [theme this site is built on](https://phlow.github.io/feeling-responsive/) uses its own [license](./LICENSE) so we need to make this clear.  

#### Connect menu
There was not agreement among the reviewers as to what should go on the "Connect" page and what may go on the "Contact" page.  This will need additional discussion.

## Remote themes

When we have a final template to use for lesson program sites, we can use remote themes to be sure that the lesson program sites structure stays consistent. More information on using remote themes is coming.
